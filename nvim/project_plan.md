# üó∫Ô∏è Project Plan & Development Log

This document outlines the initial plan for building the modular Neovim configuration and will be updated with a development log after each iteration. The primary goal is to produce three distinct, managed configurations: one for note-taking, one for general development, and one for learning that will simply load kickstart.nvim (repo located outside of this repo).

## üìù Project Plan

### Core Scaffolding & Tooling
The first part of the plan is to establish a robust project structure and set up the necessary development tools.

* **Project Structure**: The configuration will be organized as follows:
    ```
    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init.lua
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lua/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user/
    ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/
    ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ options.lua
    ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ keymaps.lua
    ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins/
    ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (individual plugin configs)
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins.lua
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ daily.md
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ weekly.md
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monthly.md
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ quarterly.md
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ yearly.md
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ zettel.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.sh
    ```
* **Plugin Manager**: **lazy.nvim** will be used for all plugin management.
* **Testing Framework**: **plenary.nvim** will be integrated as a development dependency to facilitate Test-Driven Development (TDD).

### Core Note-Taking System
This section focuses on implementing `telekasten.nvim` with its complete set of templates and dependencies for the **notes-focused configuration**.

* **Complete Template Suite**: Create all templates recognized by Telekasten in the `templates/` directory, using the correct **YAML frontmatter** syntax.
* **Core Dependency Integration**:
    * **Calendar**: Integrate **`calendar-vim`** for visual date selection.
    * **Image Preview**: Integrate **`telescope-media-files.nvim`**. The setup script will check for **`viu`** or **`catimg`** as required terminal image previewers.
    * **Image Pasting**: The setup script will handle OS-specific clipboard tools (**`xclip`** for X11, **`wl-clipboard`** for Wayland).

### Extended Functionality & UX
This section will integrate additional plugins to enhance the editing and note-taking experience, with recommendations based on current best practices.

* **Academic/Research**: Integrate **`telescope-bibtex.nvim`** for managing citations.
* **UX Enhancements**:
    * **`telescope-symbols.nvim`**: For easy insertion of symbols and emojis.
    * **`glow.nvim`**: For fast, terminal-native markdown previewing.
    * **`marksman` LSP**: For superior Table of Contents and document outline functionality.
    * **`telescope-frecency.nvim`**: For intelligent, frequency-based file history.
    * **`synctodo` script**: Documented for users in the Apple ecosystem.

### Tagging Philosophy (System Tags over Topical Tags)
Tags should be functional, not topical. Use tags to indicate what a note IS in the system, not what it is ABOUT. Examples:
- Note type / cadence: `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `quarterly`
- Lifecycle (areas/projects): `status/active`
- Note stage (maturity): `stage/seed`, `stage/sprout`, `stage/plant`, `stage/evergreen`, `stage/log`
Avoid topical tags like `#marketing` or `#python`‚Äîprefer links to atomic zettels instead. This keeps discovery consistent via Telekasten‚Äôs tag pickers and Telescope searches.

### Helper Scripts & Automation
This part of the plan focuses on creating a sophisticated setup script to manage the three distinct configurations. The best practice for managing separate-but-related configs is to use the `NVIM_APPNAME` environment variable, which creates isolated configuration directories.

* **`scripts/setup.sh`**: This shell script will be the primary tool for managing the configurations.
    * **OS Detection**: It **must** detect the operating system (Linux, macOS) to install the correct dependencies.
    * **Dependency Checks**: It will check for required CLI tools (`git`, `viu`, `xclip`, etc.) and instruct the user how to install them.
    * **Installation & Profile Management**: The script will create aliases and symlink the project files to manage the following three profiles:
        1.  **Notes Config**: A full-featured `telekasten` environment.
            * **Directory**: `~/.config/nvim-notes`
            * **Alias**: `alias nvim-notes='NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-notes nvim'`
        2.  **Dev Config**: A lightweight version for general coding, which will reuse most of the core setup but disable note-taking plugins like `telekasten`.
            * **Directory**: `~/.config/nvim-dev`
            * **Alias**: `alias nvim-dev='NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-dev nvim'`
        3.  **Learn Config**: A direct link to an external `kickstart.nvim` configuration for learning and reference. This uses the `-u` flag as it points to a single, standalone file.
            * **Path**: A user-defined `$KICKSTART_PATH` variable in the script.
            * **Alias**: `alias nvim-learn='nvim -u $KICKSTART_PATH/init.lua'`
