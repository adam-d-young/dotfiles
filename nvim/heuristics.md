# üèõÔ∏è Project Heuristics

This document outlines the guiding principles for the Neovim configuration project. The primary goal is to create a modular, high-performance, and maintainable environment. Adherence to these heuristics is mandatory to prevent "slop" and ensure a high-quality result.

## Core Principles

1.  **Modularity is Paramount**: The configuration **must** be broken down into small, single-responsibility files. A monolithic `init.lua` is unacceptable. This ensures that components can be easily enabled, disabled, debugged, or modified without side effects. The standard structure will be an `init.lua` entry point that loads modules from a `lua/` directory.

2.  **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Code should be self-explanatory. Avoid overly complex or "clever" Lua that is difficult to understand at a glance. Prioritize readability and maintainability over esoteric one-liners.

3.  **Performance Matters**: Neovim's startup time and responsiveness are critical. All plugins must be lazy-loaded using `lazy.nvim` unless there is a compelling, documented reason for them to load on startup.

4.  **Adhere to Vim Defaults**: Do not override built-in Vim motions or commands. All custom keymaps **must** use the `<leader>` key as their prefix to create a dedicated user namespace and preserve the default editing experience.

5.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: All custom Lua functions (e.g., in a `utils` or `helpers` module) **must** be developed with tests first using the `plenary.nvim` testing library. Configuration is code, and it should be reliable.

## Coding Standards

* **Language**: All configuration is to be written in **Lua**.
* **Formatting**: The entire Lua codebase **must** be formatted using **Stylua** with its default configuration. A pre-commit hook or CI action should enforce this.
* **Linting**: Use **luacheck** to identify potential errors and bad practices.
* **Lua Best Practices**:
    * Always use `local` variables to prevent polluting the global namespace.
    * Wrap potentially failing `require` calls in `pcall()` for graceful error handling, especially for plugins.
    * Use the canonical Neovim Lua APIs (`vim.keymap`, `vim.opt`, `vim.api`) instead of `vim.cmd()` wherever possible.

## Documentation

* **Comments**: Comment any non-obvious code. Explain the *why*, not the *what*.
* **README**: The project's main `README.md` should clearly explain the structure, installation process, and how to manage different configuration profiles.
